Customize the hearing range (hearingRadius), reaction speed (scanCooldownTicks), and behavior after arrival (arrivalDistance).
Choose which mobs react (entities) and what sounds attract them (sounds).
Modify the soundattractmod.toml file or use in-game config tools.

For Example, my Walking Among The Dinosaur config:

#Sound Attract Mod Configuration
